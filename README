CS259 Final Project 
Neil, Yash, Brandon, Salekh

This is the latest stable version of our compiler.

All heuristic testing code has some conflicts with our main code, so it has not been added to the tarball. 
If you would like to see the heuristic testing, please visit https://github.com/yashlala/stochastic-compiler.git, and 
checkout branch "salekh".
